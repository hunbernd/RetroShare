  [X] forums GUI should show correct restriction options for restricted forums
  [X] changing a circle's name should update the GUI

Tests
  [X] create a safe testing environment: 2 peers with no other contacts, 2 IDs each, and some forums
  [X] test #001: transactions should encrypt and decrypt ok on both sides
  [X] test #002: peers inside a circles should see the data
  [X] test #003: peers outside of a circles shouldn't see the data
  [-] test #004: peers subscribed to encrypted circles shouldn't keep asking for the data if they cannot decrypt
  [X] test #005: peers can be added/removed from circles, and the circles update between friends
  [ ] test #006: peers subscribed to encrypted circles who recently got added to the circle should get the data
  [ ] test #007: peers outside a circle shouldn't be able to post (or posts shouldn't propagate)

Backend
  [X] add debug output later RS_NXS_DEBUG_7 in rsgxsnetservice.cc for the crypto layer

Bugs
  [X] Peers cannot be removed from a circle
  [X] Context menu should not allow to edit non admin circles
  [X] Editing circles make them subscribed, even non admin ones.
  [X] Disable autosync for circles (in rsinit.cc)
  [-] Add explicit circle sync request for all grps restricted to a circle (same as IDs)
  [X] when a peer receives a circle, there is no way to view its details, only the id is available
  [X] if a peer has circles available in "Circles (others)"... if you click on
	  "Create Circle" on the gui, then all circles are automatically subscribed
